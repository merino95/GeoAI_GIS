@article{ESRI, 
    abstract = {Executive Summary In nearly every industry, executives, managers and employees are increasingly using maps in conjunction with enterprise applications such as business intelligence (BI) and CRM. Companies seek every opportunity to gain an edge, and often it's to be found in the data at their fingertips. Approximately 80% of an organization's data has a location component. By ignoring or under-utilizing this data, organizations overlook rich and pervasive information that could help them operate more efficiently and competitively. Savvy companies are generating new insights and unearthing new opportunities by mapping location-specific data. This paper explains how organizations can leverage the location components of their corporate data to visualize, model and analyze business information in new ways. The world now understands the power of a digital map, largely due to the consumerization of web mapping and the mass adoption of smartphones and tablets with default mapping apps. This consumer behavior is quickly spreading into the professional world. Increasingly, senior executives, business professionals and knowledge workers are turning to mapped data to make better business decisions. Professionals seeing trends and patterns from their mapped business information want to better understand the underlying data. TechTarget and Esri conducted a survey in 2012 and found that managers and executives commonly use mapped data for a range of reasons 1 , including: • Asset management • Business intelligence (BI) • Customer relationship management (CRM) • Enterprise resource management • Field workforce management • Operational awareness • Real estate planning • Risk management • Supply chain management Reveal More Value in Your Data with Location Analytics 1},

   abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},
